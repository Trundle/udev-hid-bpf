udev-hid-bpf
============

An automatic HID-BPF loader based on udev events. This repository aims to
provide a simple way for users to write a HID-BPF program that fixes their
device.

This project is written in Rust but knowledge of Rust should not be required,
it is only used for scaffolding, users intending to write a HID-BPF program do
not need to edit the Rust code and the resulting BPF programs have no Rust
dependencies.
